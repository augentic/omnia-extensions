//! Compiles the example guests to `wasm32-wasip2` components for the
//! component rung (`tests/component.rs`, `tests/orm.rs`) and generates
//! `gen.rs` with their path constants (`HTTP_CACHE_WASM`, `ORM_WASM`) for the
//! native side to `include!`.
//!
//! The nested build compiles this same package for `wasm32`, running this
//! script again; `Components` is a no-op under that target, so the recursion
//! stops there. The fixture uses the dev profile and lands in
//! `target/wasm32-fixtures`, a sibling of the outer profile directory shared
//! by every outer feature set, profile, and build-script hash, so plain
//! `cargo test` is self-contained and a version or toolchain bump rebuilds
//! the tree incrementally instead of leaving the last one behind under a
//! per-hash `OUT_DIR`.
