//! Examples gate: the example hosts must keep compiling.
//!
//! `http-cache/runtime.rs` and `orm/runtime.rs` are server hosts that never
//! exit, so they are **build-only** here: `cargo build --locked --examples`
//! from the package root, and exit status 0 is the whole assertion. Behaviour
//! is not tested here: the handler rungs in `crates/*/tests` drive the
//! libraries natively, and the component rungs boot these runtimes
//! in-process. Anything a host links against (the omnia runtime, the `Hooks`
//! wiring, the manifest) drifting far enough to break an example fails this
//! test before it fails a manual `make run <name>`.
//!
//! Nextest runs the test in its own process; concurrent invocations
//! serialise on cargo's build lock, so the nested build is safe to repeat.
