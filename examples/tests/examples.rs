//! Examples gate: the example hosts must keep compiling.
//!
//! `http-cache/runtime.rs` is a server host that never exits, so it is
//! **build-only** here: `cargo build --locked --examples` from the package
//! root, and exit status 0 is the whole assertion. Behaviour is not tested
//! here: the handler rung in `crates/http-cache/tests` drives the decorator
//! natively, and the component rung boots this runtime in-process. Anything
//! the host links against (the omnia runtime, the `Hooks` wiring, the
//! manifest) drifting far enough to break the example fails this test before
//! it fails a manual `make run http-cache`.
//!
//! Nextest runs the test in its own process; concurrent invocations
//! serialise on cargo's build lock, so the nested build is safe to repeat.
