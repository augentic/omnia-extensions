# Omnia Extensions

Guest-side libraries that compose on [omnia](https://github.com/augentic/omnia)
capability traits. They are not part of the runtime: omnia never depends on
this repository. Each crate is an opt-in decorator or helper that a guest
wraps around the SDK, and the same code runs inside a `wasm32-wasip2`
component and against `omnia_test` doubles natively.

## Relation to omnia

Dependency is strictly one-way. The omnia crates are published crates.io
dependencies (currently 0.36.0) declared once under
`[workspace.dependencies]` in `Cargo.toml`; every `omnia-*` crate moves
together, and there are no `[patch.crates-io]` overrides. Production
backends live in [omnia-backends](https://github.com/augentic/omnia-backends)
and are a host-side concern; nothing here talks to them.

## Crates

| Crate | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`omnia-http-cache`](crates/http-cache) | `HttpCache<H, S>` decorator over `HttpRequest` + `StateStore`. Requests carrying `Cache-Control` and `If-None-Match` are answered from, and written back through, the injected store. |
| [`omnia-orm`](crates/orm) | `entity!` mapping and typed `SELECT` / `INSERT` / `UPDATE` / `DELETE` builders that render parameterized SQL for `TableStore` to execute over `wasi:sql`. |

## Quick start

Build the HTTP cache example guest and run it with the example host.
`UPSTREAM_URL` is read from the runtime environment via `wasi:config`; any
origin that answers `GET /resource` will do:

```shell
make build http-cache
UPSTREAM_URL=https://jsonplaceholder.cypress.io/posts/1 make run http-cache
```

`GET /cached` fetches `{UPSTREAM_URL}/resource` through `HttpCache`. The
first call reaches the origin and is stored for 300 seconds; the second is
served from the store. See [`examples/http-cache/README.md`](examples/http-cache/README.md)
and the crate [header contract](crates/http-cache/README.md).

The ORM example is a two-table CRUD service over the runtime's in-memory
`SQLite`:

```shell
make build orm
make run orm
```

`POST /agencies`, `POST /agencies/{id}/feeds`, `GET /feeds` (a JOIN entity),
`PATCH /agencies/{id}`, and `DELETE /feeds/{id}` each exercise one builder;
the curl walk-through is in [`examples/orm/README.md`](examples/orm/README.md)
and the builder vocabulary in the crate [README](crates/orm/README.md).

## Testing

```shell
cargo make test              # cargo nextest run --locked --all --all-features
```

The suite is laid out as omnia's three rungs (see omnia's
[Testing Omnia-Based Code](https://github.com/augentic/omnia/blob/main/docs/guides/testing-omnia-code.md)
guide) plus a build gate for the example hosts. Everything runs under
`cargo make test`: nothing is `#[ignore]`d, and nothing needs installing
beyond `rust-toolchain.toml`, which carries the `wasm32-wasip2` target the
component rung compiles for.

### Handler rung

`crates/http-cache/tests/cache.rs` drives `HttpCache` natively against
`omnia_test::guest::Provider` (`MatchedHttp` + `Memory`). Scenarios cover
miss-then-hit, `no-cache` refresh (with `max-age`) and bypass (without),
`max-age=0` revalidation, `no-store` bypass, non-2xx and 206 not stored, a corrupt
entry and a store outage both degrading to the origin, pass-through without
`Cache-Control` or with only unrecognised directives, and malformed
directives. Unit tests
for the `Cache-Control` parser live beside it in `src/control.rs`.

`crates/orm/tests/orm.rs` runs each builder's `Query` through the same
`Provider`, whose `ScriptedTables` records the SQL text and `$n` parameters
that reach `TableStore` and answers with scripted rows. Scenarios cover a
filtered, ordered, limited select mapped back through `Entity::from_row`
(including `NULL` → `None` and RFC 3339 timestamps), insert from an entity,
an `ON CONFLICT` upsert, a filtered update and delete, a JOIN entity with
aliased columns, and a missing column failing row mapping. Unit tests for
SQL rendering and type conversion live beside the builders in `src/`.

### Component rung

`examples/tests/component.rs` boots the HTTP cache example guest — compiled
to a `wasm32-wasip2` component by `examples/build.rs` — through the example
host's own `runtime!` wiring over `omnia_test::host::Backends`. A loopback
origin records hits; one scenario, `cached_miss_then_hit`, asserts both
handler responses, a single origin fetch, and the keyvalue envelope under
the raw etag.

`examples/tests/orm.rs` boots the ORM example guest the same way, over the
bundle's private in-memory `SQLite`. One scenario, `agency_feed_lifecycle`,
chains the routes in-process: create an agency, list and update it, add a
feed, read the feed back through the JOIN entity carrying the updated agency
name, delete it, read an empty list, and see the second delete answered as
not found.

### Examples gate

`examples/tests/examples.rs::build` runs `cargo build --locked --examples`
from the package root, so both example hosts compile. The hosts in
`examples/http-cache/runtime.rs` and `examples/orm/runtime.rs` are servers
that never exit, so they are compiled, not run; the component rung is where
their wiring is exercised.

## Development

```shell
make ci         # fmt, clippy (native + wasm), test, docs, vet, outdated, deny
```

`make ci` is the whole gate: every rung above, including both component
rungs and the examples gate, runs inside `make test`. The workspace follows
omnia's conventions: stable toolchain (`rust-toolchain.toml`, with the
`wasm32-wasip2` target), edition 2024, workspace lints, `cargo vet`
supply-chain audits (`supply-chain/`), and CI as thin wrappers over the
reusable workflows in `augentic/.github`.
